By what is shown by the results of the program, hit rate increases as associativity increases.
The fully associative cache had the highest number of hits, therefore having the highest hit rate.
The two-way associative cache had the least number of hits, therefore having the lowest hit rate.
Overall, the direct-mapped and fully associative caches had the highest hit rate among all four different types of caches.
